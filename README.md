# Natours - Responsive Landing Page

Natours is a fully responsive and stylish landing page designed for a business offering exciting tours for adventurous people. The project demonstrates the use of modern CSS and HTML techniques, along with Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) for building a visually appealing and functional frontend. The design is inspired by a real-world business landing page with rich features such as a navigation menu, cards for different tours, testimonials, a booking form, and more.
